# Advent Of Code 2022

My own solutions in C# ConsoleApp for the problems in this years advent of code event.

// apart from day 22 where part 2 was hardcoded for my own input, other days should work with any input

// Each day should display both part 1 and part 2 solution

## Also solved in Ruby!

Just run any of the day scripts from command line with the shell scoped onto the Ruby folder.
Add your login cookie to session.txt for auto input fetching or you can manually add the input{day}.txt to the inputs/ folder (create it if there is none)

For example to run day1 just use the command
```
ruby day01.rb
```
